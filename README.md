# dotfiles
### Personalized configurations for enhancing productivity

A collection of my dotfiles tailored for a seamless development experience. This repository houses my custom settings for:

- **yabai**: A next-generation tiling window manager for macOS. Fine-tuned for optimal window management and efficient workspace organization.
- **vim**: My favorite text editor made even more powerful. Featuring plugins, keybindings, and themes that I've come to rely on over the years.

ðŸŒŸ Feel free to fork, star, and contribute! Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.
