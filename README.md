# dotfiles
### Personalized configurations for enhancing productivity

A collection of my dotfiles tailored for a seamless development experience. This repository houses my custom settings for:

- **yabai**: A next-generation tiling window manager for macOS. Fine-tuned for optimal window management and efficient workspace organization.
- **vim**: My favorite text editor made even more powerful. Featuring plugins, keybindings, and themes that I've come to rely on over the years.
- **skhd**: A simple hotkey daemon for macOS. My custom keybindings to streamline actions and workflows.

ðŸŒŸ Feel free to fork, star, and contribute! Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.
